# ❤️ Heart Disease Risk Stratification System

A production-style machine learning system for predicting **cardiovascular risk** using structured clinical data.

This project goes beyond basic modeling by focusing on **data integrity, clinical reasoning, and decision thresholds**, making it closer to a real-world healthcare ML workflow.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project formulates heart disease prediction as a **binary risk stratification problem**, not diagnosis.

The objective is to identify **high-risk patients early**, enabling further clinical evaluation.

Key characteristics:

- End-to-end ML pipeline
- Leakage-free preprocessing
- Clinical metric prioritization (recall)
- Threshold optimization for real-world tradeoffs
- Interactive inference via Streamlit

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
- Samples: **302 (after cleaning)**
- Features: 13 clinical variables
- Target:
  - `0 → Low Risk`
  - `1 → High Risk`

### ⚠️ Critical Data Issue (Key Insight)

The dataset initially appeared as **1025 rows**, but:

- **723 duplicate records were discovered**
- This artificially inflated performance

After removing duplicates:

- Dataset reduced to **302 rows**
- Model performance became realistic

👉 This was the most important engineering correction in the project.

---

## 🧠 Problem Framing

This is a **screening problem**, not a diagnostic system.

### Why this matters:

- False Negative → Miss a high-risk patient ❌ (dangerous)
- False Positive → Extra testing ✅ (acceptable)

👉 Therefore:

**Recall > Precision**

---

## ⚙️ ML Pipeline

### Steps:

1. Data loading and validation
2. Duplicate detection and removal
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Train/Test split
5. Preprocessing via `ColumnTransformer`
6. Model training:
   - Logistic Regression
   - KNN
   - Random Forest
7. Hyperparameter tuning
8. Threshold optimization
9. Model serialization (`.pkl`)
10. Streamlit deployment

---

## 🧩 Key Engineering Decisions

### 1. Duplicate Removal (Critical)
- Prevented **data leakage**
- Avoided inflated performance

### 2. Proper Feature Treatment
Categorical variables handled correctly:
- `cp`, `thal`, `slope`, `restecg`

### 3. Leakage-Free Pipeline
Used:
- `Pipeline`
- `ColumnTransformer`

Ensures:
- Train/test separation integrity

### 4. Metric Selection (Clinical Reasoning)
- Prioritized **Recall**
- Not accuracy (misleading in healthcare)

### 5. Threshold Optimization
Moved from:
- `0.5 → 0.4`

To improve sensitivity.

## 📈 Model Performance

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|----|
| Logistic Regression | 0.836 | 0.848 | 0.848 | 0.848 |
| KNN | 0.836 | 0.871 | 0.818 | 0.844 |
| Random Forest | 0.803 | 0.818 | 0.818 | 0.818 |

---

## 🏆 Final Model

**Logistic Regression**

### Why:

- Best balance across metrics
- Stable after cleaning
- Interpretable (important in healthcare)
- Works well on small tabular datasets

---

## 🎯 Threshold Optimization

| Threshold | Recall | Precision |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 0.3 | 0.970 | 0.653 |
| 0.4 | 0.939 | 0.795 |
| 0.5 | 0.848 | 0.848 |
| 0.6 | 0.636 | 0.913 |

### Final Choice:
**0.4**

👉 Maximizes detection of high-risk patients while keeping precision acceptable.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Small dataset (302 samples)
- Not clinically validated
- No external validation set
- Not suitable for real-world medical use

---

## 📚 Key Learnings

- Data quality > model complexity
- Duplicate leakage can destroy evaluation integrity
- Metrics must align with domain (recall for healthcare)
- Threshold tuning is critical in real systems
- Simpler models can outperform complex ones on structured data

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is for **educational and portfolio purposes only**.

It is **NOT a medical diagnosis tool** and must not be used for clinical decisions.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Add ROC curve visualization
- Deploy online (Streamlit Cloud)
- Add SHAP explanations
- Collect real-world data
- Build API (FastAPI)
